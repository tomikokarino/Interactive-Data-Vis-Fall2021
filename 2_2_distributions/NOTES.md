I managed to add country name as text label to each dot, but it's impossible to see each country name where they overlap.  Ideally, I want to hover over each dot to reveal more information for each country/dot.  I researched about .onmouseover/.onmousemove/.onmouseout functions but was not able to scucessfully implement the behaviors.  

Ideally, I also wanted to combine the colorLegend and sizeLegend so that the viewer would understand that the colors and sizes of dots correspond with HDI score.  I managed to import the d3-legend module but was not able to combine the two.
